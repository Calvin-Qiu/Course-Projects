When I run test 08-staffTest, program 1 received a move from program 2(staff solution) and reported “* White wins” as required. However, program 2 is not responding after it received this message, causing the test to fail. Here’s the last few lines from the test result:
[1]> > * i3-j3(j2)
[2]< i3-j3(j2)
[2]> > * d6-c6(d6)
[1]< d6-c6(d6)
[1]> > * White wins.
[2]> > [1]> > 
Program 1 ended with: time limit exceeded waiting for opponent

In any other tests that involves two AI(my solution) playing against each other, the win messages are always successfully exchanged and the program quits with no problem. Please give me a hint on how to address this! Thank you.
