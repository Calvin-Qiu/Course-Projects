This projects implements a few optimization strategies on a trained Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification. Following is a summary of the optimization:  
路 The CNN runtime is analyzed using Gprof profiling  
路 Achieved a 400% speedup by parallelizing the convolution computation with SIMD vector operations  
路 Achieved another 400% speedup by implementing multi-threading using OpenMP  
路 Achieved in total a 1600% speedup that significantly reduced the average runtime of the CNN
